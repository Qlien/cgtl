* Implement const_iterators;
	- OK, seems to be working.

* Check if an edge already exist before insert it;
	- OK, seems to be working.

* Implement edge and vertice iterators: an easy way to get just the vertices's, or just the edges's values, without take care about the links, the adjacency list, etc.;
	- OK, seems to be working.

* Implement undirected graph: as a type or an attribute to the already existing types;
	- OK.

* Implement multigraph and hypergraph (?): is it realy necessary for now?;
* Implement intelligent iterators: depth first search, breadth first search, dijkstra, etc..

* What should I do when the user tries to insert duplicated vertices or edges? What does STL do?
