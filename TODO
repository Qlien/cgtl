* Implement const_iterators;
* Check if an edge already exist before insert it;
* Implement edge and vertice iterators: an easy way to get just the vertices, or just the edges's values, without take care about the links, the adjacency list, etc.;
* Implement undirected graph: as a type or an attribute to the already existing types;
* Implement multigraph and hypergraph (?): is it realy necessary for now?;
* Implement intelligent iterators: depth first search, breadth first search, dijkstra, etc..
